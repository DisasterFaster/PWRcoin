### Powercoin <img src="https://d25lcipzij17d.cloudfront.net/badge.svg?id=gh&type=6&v=1.0.0.0&x2=0">

**Important Notice:** While Power Coin is a great coin it suffers some nearly fatal issues that must be addressed. Without getting overly technical let's simply say that the code has issues which create an out of control staking situtation. Over time this has led to broken wallets, negative balances, exchange de-listings, coin devaluation and other problems. 

At the moment it appears that the best path to healing this coin will include a major rebranding, a new digital footprint, code rework and fixes all followed by a paid marketing push. The current development team is already in motion handling this variety of tasks and will give new updates as they become available.

**Development Updates**

A totally new block explorer has been created and you can find that at https://blockexplorer.pwr-coin.com/
A totally new website is being developed and it will go live at https://pwr-coin.com
The coin is currently being traded at Yobit: https://yobit.net/en/trade/PWR/DOGE

Current tasks that are being worked on include, new logo, new client identity, new website, VPS node for testnet testing, new Facebook page, new Twitter page, new Google Plus page, new YouTube page, analysis of code deficiences to determine necessary code rework to correct the too high POS, too high coin supply and QT wallet crashes when staking on Windows operating systems.

**Important Note:** *The current development team handling the tasks listed above have no connection to nor assocation with any other group and specifically the individual or group that has been conducting a swap of these coins for tokens on the Waves platform.*
